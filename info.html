    <h2>Plot and story</h2>
    <p>A young woman named Madeline begins climbing Celeste Mountain, ignoring a warning from an old woman named Granny who says"You might see things, things you ain't ready to see!" After beginning her trek, Madaline makes her way through a deserted city, where she can meet a fellow traveler named Theo who is addicted to instapics. Madeline camps out for the night and has a dream in which a dark reflection of herself, named Badeline, breaks out of a mirror, and attempts to stop Madeline's climb by chasing her down, but Madeline escapes from her and wakes up from her nightmare. Madeline continues into an old hotel on the mountain, where the hotel's ghostly concierge (a literal lost soul, or ghost), Mr. Oshiro, tries to persuade Madeline to stay despite the dingy condition of the hotel. She reluctantly entertains him by cleaning part of the resort, but he is keen on having her stay for a night. This leads to Badeline reappearing and creating an escape for Madeline, but insulting Oshiro in the process, enraging him. He chases Madeline with death as his intent, but he gives up and Madeline continues the climb. After traveling through the Golden Ridge and meeting Granny again, Madeline meets up with Theo at a gondola. Badeline appears again and stalls the lift, giving Madeline a panic attack. Theo calms her down, and Badaline's influence ends. With the gondola moving again, they arrive at an ancient temple. Theo ends up separated and trapped inside a mirror. Later, Theo gets encased in a magic crystal of his own creation, and monsters given form from Madeline and Theo's insecurities attack them. She finds Theo and carries him out of the temple. After breaking Theo's crystal and escaping from the temple and the mirror realm, Madeline and Theo set up camp. Madeline tells Theo about the reflection and confides in him about her mental health issues before resting. During the night, she seeks out Badeline and expresses her wishes to leave her behind. This infuriates Badeline, and drags Madeline down to the base of the mountain. Stuck in a cave at the bottom of the mountain, Madeline meets the old woman again, who suggests that Badeline might be scared and says that Madeline should try talking instead of abandoning her. Madeline searches for Badeline again, apologizes for pushing her away and vows to climb the mountain together. Badeline initially lashes out at Madeline trying to kill her, but relents and forgives her. Badeline and Madeline merge, and they work their way back up the mountain, before finally reaching the summit.</p>
